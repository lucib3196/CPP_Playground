# LearningC

C++ Playground a lightweight repo where I dump all my C++ experiments, mini-projects, and random practice files.

This isn't meant to be a polished project or portfolio its simply meant for

- Learn C++ by building things from scratch

- Test out new concepts, patterns, and features

- Experiment with algorithms, data structures, and low-level ideas

- Keep track of my progress as I get better at the language

Notable Projects

Whenever I build something more complete, I’ll link it here:

- (Coming soon — I’ll add links once I finish a few solid projects!)

## Resources

Most of the resources I'm following as I learn C++ are:
